This is a repeat data collection from report 14; both with a confidence level of 3 sigma.
Score differentials had a different confidence intervals; but not radically.
All effect signs (null, increase in score, decrease) are the same.
This indicates that our measurement methodology is accurate enough
to estimate whether a change is an improvement or not and to distinguish
what order of magnitude the effect size is in.

This also underlines the need to model the non-linear impact of
environmental performance differences on score collection.

All in all this is a good result, indicating that the model
is ready for some use!

Next step is to validate these results on another machine.
